Usage
=====

django-birthday provides a :class:`birthday.fields.BirthdayField` model field
type which is a subclass of :class:`django.db.models.DateField` and thus has the
same characteristics as that. It also internally adds a second field to your
model holding the day of the year for that birthday, this is used for the extra
functionality exposed by :class:`birthday.managers.BirthdayManager` which you
should use as the manager on your model.


A model could look like this::

    from django.db import models
    from django.conf import settings
    
    import birthday


    class UserProfile(models.Model):
        user = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL)
        birthday = birthday.fields.BirthdayField()
        
        objects = birthday.managers.BirthdayManager()
        
        
Get all user profiles within the next 30 days::

    UserProfile.objects.get_upcoming_birthdays()
    
Get all user profiles which have their birthday today::

    UserProfile.objects.get_birthdays()
    
Or order the user profiles according to their birthday::

    UserProfile.objects.order_by_birthday()
